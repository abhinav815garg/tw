# Vector Dot-Product
The [**dot product**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) (or scalar product) of two vectors is a mathematical operation that takes two vectors and returns a single scalar (real number). It is defined as the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors and the _cosine_ of the angle between them.

Mathematically, if two vectors are given as: **A** = <a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>> and **B** = <b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>3</sub>>, their dot-product is given as:\
**A.B** = a<sub>1</sub>.b<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>2</sub>.b<sub>2</sub> + a<sub>3</sub>.b<sub>3</sub>\
or\
**A.B** = |**A**|.|**B**|. $Cos\theta$\
where, |**X**| = Magnitude of vector X, and\
$\theta$ = Angle between two vectors

### Properties
- Commutative: **A.B** = **B.A**
- Distributive: **A.(B+C)** = **A.B + A.C**
- Associative: **(cA).B** = **c.(A.B)**
> [!Note]
> Associativity is only valid if multiplied by scalar only.
